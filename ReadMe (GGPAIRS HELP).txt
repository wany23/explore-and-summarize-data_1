I was not able to get ggpairs to plot without the axis labels.  I tried a variety of different syntax, and searched google for suggestions, yet nothing seemed to work.  Some solutions involved plotting each graph separately, but I feel that kind of defeats the purpose of the ggpairs function.  Any help to get my ggpairs plot in a readable form (for the axes text) would be appreciated.
